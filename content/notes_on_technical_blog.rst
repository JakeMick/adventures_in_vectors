*Techical Blogging: Turn Your Expertise into a Remarkable Online Presence
by Antonio Cangiano* is offered by The Pragmatic Bookshelf at PragProg_.

From the site:
    Technical Blogging is the first book to specifically teach programmers,
    technical people, and technically-oriented entrepreneurs how to become 
    successful bloggers. There is no magic to successful blogging; with this book 
    youâ€™ll learn the techniques to attract and keep a large audience of loyal,
    regular readers and leverage this popularity to achieve your goals.

Now that that is out of the way post is primarily aimed at being as
**meta-edgy** as I possible can, while abusing reStructuredText_ and Pelican_.

*Phew*. So let's get down to the d33ts. I follow a bunch of technical reading
circles and blogs. I read so much $LaTeX$ that I speak in $\\int$s, but I
haven't contribute to much besides some Q/A on StackExchange and r/MachineLearning_.

2013 will the year that this changes. So I downloaded a DRM-Free copy of
*Technical Blogging*.
