A car is a big purchase. Few of us buy one on an impulse. You decide that
you're going to buy a car, you narrow it down to a few models and you're
almost ready to pull the trigger when you get a massive salary bump.

You call your wife to tell her. She informs you that your daughter needs
braces and your dog went through your savings on online Poker. (Screenname: d3vil_Bernard2004)

Ye olde cocktail napkin reveals that you're still up $290/month. The BMW in the back
of your head through lunch seems within reach.

Life is crazy. Your budget oscillates wildly, but you have to pull the trigger
before the Fiesta dies in rush-hour.

The Chaos

This post is our attempt to explore the trends in the chaos of U.S. budgets for
new cars.

The magenta line is the 100,000's of car sales we processed each day in 2011.
Sales jumps up and down consistently depending on where we on in a month.
There doesn't appear to be a trend for different seasons.

Looking just at the trend it becomes apparent that the there is a massive
200,000+ swing in sales that takes place through the month.

We can zoom in on the trend for a given month. Right around the 10th there's
a spike in sales. Followed by a slow decline to the low around the 25th. On
average our customers sign their leases half-way between billing cycles.

See? The chaos alluded to at the top of this post is cyclical for
U.S. households. How likely you are to purchase a car depends on many factors,
but these factors come in monthly trends.

See you on the 10th. -- JakeMick
