    Lets say I trained an SVM model on some training data. I then remove the
    support vectors from the training data and re-train the model. The new model
    will have new support vectors. But, what all has changed in this new model? Can
    I confidently say that the new model performs worse than the previous one?

Obviously this isn't the best idea. The support vectors define the max-margin
used by the SVM. Deleting them is censoring your most valuable evidence.

Now what actually happens to the hyperplane when you delete the support vectors?
The margin must get wider, that's a given. But how dramatically could you make
the angle change in $t+1$ from $t$ given the most pathological data for a linear kernel?

Turns out, not very much. I figured a multivariate Gaussian XOR
data set would be a perfect edge-case. It also isn't that ridiculous of a real
world data set. My thought was that the support vectors would be defined by
the smaller end of the Gaussian tail. Those would be deleted, and the hyperplane
would play Twister in front of my eyes. *I was definitely wrong.*

This is by no means a formal proof, but repeatedly running it couldn't get the
hyperplane to tilt.

Most of the points are support vectors.

.. image:: two_svm_xor.png
   :align: right


.. image:: three_svm_xor.png
   :align: right

.. image:: four_svm_xor.png
   :align: right

.. image:: five_svm_xor.png

Repeating this over and over with randomly generated XOR data didn't change it.
Turns out that the soft margin is pretty robust to data censoring
in cases that are directly pathological to how the hyperplane is formed. It
digs a trough in the margin.

The code for those interested.
